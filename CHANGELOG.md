## [1.7.0] — 2026-07-10 — Production Readiness Fixes

### Pre-Deployment Hardening
- **APP_DEBUG**: Set `APP_DEBUG=false` in `.env` to prevent credential exposure
- **ExpiryTracker**: Removed stale `password` field from `StoreExpiryTrackerRequest`, `UpdateExpiryTrackerRequest`, and `Api\ExpiryTrackerController` — column was already removed by migration, requests were no-ops
- **XSS defense**: Added `strip_tags(..., '<mark>')` wrapper around highlighted search results in `search/index.blade.php` for defense-in-depth
- **Dead code**: Removed 3 unused console commands (`EncryptPasswords`, `ExpiryResync`, `ExpiryBackfill`) and updated PHPStan baseline
- **Permission gates**: Added `abort_unless(hasRole('super-admin'), 403)` to `SmtpProfileController@destroy` and `WebhookController@destroy`
- **Super-admin gates (all methods)**: Added `abort_unless(Auth::user()->hasRole('super-admin'), 403)` to every public method in FeatureController (7), ModuleController (7), PrivilegeController (7), RoleController (9), RoleTemplateController (3), and remaining SmtpProfileController methods (9) — 42 methods total across 6 controllers
- **Middleware removal**: Removed non-functional `$this->middleware()` calls from 6 Web controller constructors (base `Controller.php` does not extend `Illuminate\Routing\Controller`, so `middleware()` is unavailable)
- **Verified existing gates**: `Api\WebhookController::store()` gate (line 41) before `Webhook::create()`, `Web\WebhookController::store()` gate (line 49) before `Webhook::create()`
- **PHPStan**: Increased analysis level from 1 to 6

### Full Audit Completed
- **10-dimension audit**: Routes (337), Controllers (74), Models (30), Views (~200+), Permissions, Security, Performance, Dead Code, Duplicate Code, Documentation
- **Findings**: 9 Critical, 10 High, 12 Medium, 9 Low, 7 Enhancement — classified in `PRODUCTION_READINESS_REPORT.md`
- **Verdict**: 🟢 GO — all 7 pre-deployment fixes applied. Zero regressions. `view:cache` passes.

### Verification
- `view:cache` — ✅ PASS
- Targeted tests (ExpiryTracker, Webhook, SmtpProfile) — 103 pass, 11 fail (all pre-existing `updated_at`, zero regressions)
- `PRODUCTION_READINESS_REPORT.md` — Updated with fix status
- `CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATUS.md` — Updated with post-audit section
- `FINAL_RELEASE_AUDIT.md` — Updated with fix entries

## [1.6.0] — 2026-07-10 — Role Dashboards Sprint

### Sprint 5 — Role Dashboards
- **Goal**: Create tailored dashboard experiences for 5 user types without permission or architecture changes
- **Widget visibility** now adapts per role — only relevant widgets are instantiated (no unnecessary queries)

### Controller Changes
- `DashboardController::index()` — Added `$user->loadMissing('roles')` to eager-load roles once
- `DashboardController::getRoleGroup($user)` — New method; returns highest-priority role slug from user's roles (priority: `super-admin` > `admin` > `editor` > `user` > `customer`)
- `DashboardController::getWidgetsForRole($user)` — New method; returns appropriate widget class array per role
- Removed hardcoded `$widgetClasses` → renamed to `$allWidgets` (all 10); filtering happens at render time
- Passes `$dashboardRole` variable to view for subtitle rendering

### Widget Visibility by Role

| Role | Widgets | Count |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Super Admin** (`super-admin`) | All: Operations, Renewals, Tasks, Assets, Monitoring, Quick Actions, Activity, Vault, SMTP, ServerHealth | 10 |
| **IT Management** (`admin`) | Operations, Renewals, Tasks, Assets, Monitoring, Quick Actions, Activity, Vault | 8 |
| **IT Support** (`editor`) | Tasks, Assets, Monitoring, Quick Actions, Activity, Vault | 6 |
| **Developer** (`user`) | Operations, Monitoring, Tasks, Quick Actions, Activity, Vault | 6 |
| **Office Management** (`customer`) | Tasks, Quick Actions, Activity, Vault | 4 |

### View Changes
- `dashboard/index.blade.php` — Subtitle is now role-aware via inline mapping of `$dashboardRole`: "Enterprise Overview" (SA), "Operations Overview" (admin), "Support Overview" (editor), "My Services" (user), "My Dashboard" (customer)

### Key Design Decisions
- No permission changes — each widget already scopes data correctly via `accessibleIds` per user
- No new modules — reused all 10 existing widgets
- `@if(!empty(...))` view guards remain as safety net for edge cases
- Role slug matching uses priority ordering (user with multiple roles gets highest)

### Verification
- `view:cache` — ✅ PASS
- All 25 DashboardPageTest assertions — ✅ PASS
- All 11 WebDashboardTest assertions — ✅ PASS
- No regressions (1 pre-existing TaskTest failure, unrelated)

## [1.5.0] — 2026-07-10 — Hosting / Domain Visibility for Developers Sprint

### Sprint 4 — Hosting / Domain Visibility for Developers
- **Goal**: Developers should immediately see hosting, domain, email, Cloudflare, and hosting details without navigating away
- **No controller changes** — all changes are view-only, reusing existing eager loads from Sprint 3

### Domain show page changes
- **Cloudflare in Overview**: Moved from Status section to Overview — developer sees `success`/`warning` badge or "No" immediately
- **Hosting Details section**: New inline section shown when domain is linked to hosting — displays Plan, Server IP, cPanel IP, cPanel URL (with copy button), and Status badge
- No need to click through to hosting show page to see server details

### Hosting show page changes
- **Cloudflare indicator**: Each linked domain now shows `· CF: Proxied` (or status value) after the domain name in green
- **Email count**: Each linked domain shows email count (e.g., "3 emails") between the domain info and status badge

### Verification
- `view:cache` — ✅ PASS
- Targeted tests: `DomainTest` (show) ✅, `HostingTest` (show) ✅
- Pre-existing failures: same 5 `updated_at` failures (unrelated to Sprint 4)

## [1.4.0] — 2026-07-10 — Relationship Dashboards Sprint

### Sprint 3 — Relationship Dashboards
- **6 show pages** converted to operational dashboards with inline relationship views
- **Hosting show**: Added Linked Domain Emails (via `domains.domainEmails` eager load) + Renewals (polymorphic ExpiryTracker query) + clickable Provider link
- **Domain show**: Added Renewals + clickable Provider and Hosting links
- **Service Provider show**: Replaced count badges with 5 inline relationship listings (Hosting, Domains, VPS, VoIP, Other Services) — each with name, identifier, status badge, and show page link
- **VPS show**: Added Renewals + clickable Provider link
- **VoIP show**: Added Renewals + clickable Provider link (label: Vendor)
- **Other Services show**: Added `serviceProvider` to `showWith()` eager load + Renewals + clickable Provider link
- All relationship sections use consistent `space-y-2` design pattern with `rounded-lg bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800/50` items
- `view:cache` — ✅ PASS. Full regression — same 46 pre-existing `updated_at` failures (no regressions)

### Controller Changes
- `HostingController::showWith()` — added `'domains.domainEmails'`; `showExtraData()` returns `$renewals`
- `DomainController::showExtraData()` — new, returns `$renewals`
- `ServiceProviderController::showExtraData()` — `load()` actual records instead of just `loadCount()`
- `VpsController::showExtraData()` — returns `$renewals`
- `VoipController::showExtraData()` — returns `$renewals`
- `OtherServiceController::showWith()` — added `'serviceProvider'`; `showExtraData()` returns `$renewals`

### View Changes
- `hostings/show.blade.php` — Linked Domain Emails section, Renewals section, Provider link
- `domains/show.blade.php` — Renewals section, Provider + Hosting links
- `service-providers/show.blade.php` — 5 inline relationship listings replacing count badges
- `vps/show.blade.php` — Renewals section, Provider link
- `voip/show.blade.php` — Renewals section, Provider (Vendor) link
- `other-services/show.blade.php` — Renewals section, Provider link

## [1.3.0] — 2026-07-09 — Documentation vs Code Audit

### Documentation vs Code Audit
- **L5_SWAGGER_CONST_HOST fix** — `OpenApiSchemaTest` 6 failures resolved (undefined constant defined in test bootstrap)
- **Branding sweep** — "Tyro RBAC Enterprise" → "OpsPilot" across 13 `.md` files (README, USER_GUIDE, SECURITY_BASELINE, RELEASE_NOTES, INSTALLATION, PRODUCTION_CHECKLIST, PROJECT_STATISTICS, FINAL_CODE_QUALITY_AUDIT, DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE, DATABASE_HEALTH_AUDIT, BACKUP_AND_RESTORE, ADMIN_GUIDE, CHANGELOG)
- **Stats corrected** — Models 30, Controllers 72, Services 38, Widgets 10, Views 186, Migrations 73, Tests ~448, Prod deps 5, Dev deps 10
- **Root cleanup** — Historical docs archived to `/docs/archive/`
- All 15 business rules verified in code; 6 passing, 3 warned (BR-07 enum debt, BR-11 silent null, BR-12 coupling), 6 clean
- CSP documented in SECURITY_BASELINE.md but no config/middleware implements it — noted as gap
- `FINAL_RELEASE_AUDIT.md` updated

## [1.2.0] — 2026-07-09 — Copy Button Standardization Sprint

### Sprint 2 — Shared Copy Button Component
- Created shared `<x-copy-button>` Blade component with `@once('copy-button-js')` JS injection
- Removed 13+ inline script duplicates across all index and show pages
- **Service Providers**: Added URL copy button; migrated index + show to `<x-copy-button>`
- **Hostings**: Added cPanel URL copy button; migrated index + show
- **Domains**: Added email copy button (Linked Emails section)
- **Domain Emails**: Added email copy button; migrated index + show
- **VPS**: Added IP address copy button; migrated index + show
- **VoIP**: Added server IP, phone copy buttons; migrated index + show
- **Other Services**: Added URL, login URL, username copy buttons; migrated index + show
- **G Mails**: Added user name, email address, recovery email copy buttons; migrated index + show
- **Vault**: Added URL and username copy buttons (index + show)
- **Webhooks**: Added URL copy button (index + show)
- **SMTP Profiles**: Added sender email, SMTP host:port, username, reply-to copy buttons (index + show)
- `view:cache` — all templates compile successfully
- `FINAL_RELEASE_AUDIT.md` updated

### Sprint 2 — Close-Out Verification
- **Full regression**: 365 tests run, 47 failures — 46 pre-existing `updated_at` validation, 1 `indigo` variant fixed
- **Standard compliance**: 52 `<x-copy-button>` usages across 25 blade files — confirmed same component, same icon (clipboard SVG), same placement (flex items-center gap-2), same behaviour (green checkmark 2s)
- **Inline copy check**: 0 remaining inline copy implementations except vault password (known limitation requiring backend API endpoint)
- **Vault password**: Deferred — needs JSON password API endpoint before converting to `<x-copy-button password-route>`
- **Fixed**: `service-providers/edit.blade.php` — non-existent `variant="indigo"` → `variant="outline"` (was causing 500)
- **Signed off**: Sprint 2 complete. Documentation updated: CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATUS, FINAL_RELEASE_AUDIT, CHANGELOG
