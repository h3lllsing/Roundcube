# OpsPilot v1.3 — Final Release Audit

## Documentation vs Code Audit (2026-07-09)

### Corrected
- **OpenApiSchemaTest**: 6 failures fixed — `L5_SWAGGER_CONST_HOST` defined in test bootstrap (was an undefined constant in PHP attribute constructor)
- **Branding sweep**: "Tyro RBAC Enterprise" → "OpsPilot" across 13 `.md` files
- **Root cleanup**: 200+ historical `.md` files archived to `/docs/archive/` per `DOCUMENT_CLEANUP_PLAN.md`. Root holds 20 active files.
- **Statistics corrected** in CHANGELOG, README, PROJECT_STATISTICS, CURRENT_EXECUTION_STATUS

### Discrepancies Found (all now corrected in docs)

| Metric | Previously Claimed | Actual |
|--------|-------------------|--------|
| Tests | 1278 / 111 | ~448 (442 pass + 6 → 0 after fix) |
| Models | 27 | 30 |
| Controllers | 70 | 72 (38 Web + 34 API) |
| Services | 23 | 38 |
| Dashboard Widgets | 9 | 10 |
| Blade Views | 151 | 186 |
| Migrations | 54 | 73 |
| Composer Prod Deps | 6 | 5 |
| Composer Dev Deps | 9 | 10 |

### Gaps Noted (no code change)
- **CSP**: Documented in SECURITY_BASELINE.md Layer 4 — no config/middleware implements it
- **BR-07, BR-11, BR-12**: Design debts remain (moduleSlug string contract, silent null module_id, controller coupling)
- **moduleSlug()**: 31 call sites across Web controllers — no enum

---

## Architecture Lock

**Philosophy:** Independent business entities, connected through relationship-driven operational dashboards, with a standardized interface that makes every page feel familiar.

See `PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE_LOCK.md` for the complete locked philosophy.

## Document Cleanup

Root holds 20 active `.md` files. 200+ historical records are organized in `docs/`:
- `docs/archive/` — completed audits, reports, patch notes, sprint reports, phase reports
- `docs/archive/obsolete/` — superseded/duplicate files
- `docs/reference/guides/` — user guides, deployment guides, installation
- `docs/reference/architecture/` — specs, API references, architecture decisions
- `docs/reference/design/` — UI/UX audits, workflow analysis
- `docs/reference/monitoring/` — monitoring specs
- `docs/reference/security/` — security baseline, technical debt
- `docs/reference/audits/` — design system audits
- `docs/operations/` — operational documentation
- `docs/analysis/` — future analysis documents
- `docs/proposals/` — future proposals
